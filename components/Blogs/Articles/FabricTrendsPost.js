        <div className="space-y-6">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Sustainable & Eco-Friendly Fabrics</h2>
          <p>
            Sustainability is no longer a niche — it’s mainstream. Expect a rise in upholstery fabrics made from recycled polyester, organic cotton, and plant-based fibers. Eco-conscious clients, especially in hospitality and education, are requesting green certifications with their bulk orders.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Textured Neutrals</h2>
          <p>
            Think tweed, bouclé, and chenille in soft creams, taupes, and sand tones. These textured neutrals bring depth to minimalist interiors and are highly requested for hotel lounges and office furniture.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Earthy Color Palettes</h2>
          <p>
            Warm terracotta, olive green, clay, and mustard are replacing greys. These earthy tones create inviting spaces in hospitality, wellness, and church environments.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Velvet Revival</h2>
          <p>
            Velvet remains a favorite, but now it’s all about washable, commercial-grade velvets for high-traffic areas. Ideal for hotel lobbies, luxury lounges, and executive spaces.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Performance Fabrics</h2>
          <p>
            Stain-resistant, antimicrobial, and fade-proof upholstery is rising across healthcare, education, and public sector tenders. These functional textiles will dominate 2025 tender specs.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">6. Artisanal Prints & Woven Patterns</h2>
          <p>
            Inspired by local crafts, ethnic motifs, and geometric weaving, these designs are increasingly being used in interior design for schools, boutiques, and cultural spaces.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">7. Matte Finishes Over Shine</h2>
          <p>
            Shiny polyester is out — matte-finished fabric is in. It offers a sophisticated, modern look without glare, especially appealing to corporate and contemporary spaces.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">8. Oversized Textures</h2>
          <p>
            Fabrics with large, bold textures — like waffle weaves and jumbo knits — are gaining traction for accent furniture. Designers love them for depth and personality.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">9. Outdoor-Inspired Fabrics Indoors</h2>
          <p>
            UV-resistant and weatherproof fabrics are being used indoors — especially in sunny regions or semi-open lounges. Think breezy coastal cafes and patios.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">10. Custom Color Matching & Branding</h2>
          <p>
            More businesses are requesting brand-aligned color palettes in their upholstery, especially for franchise rollouts and branded interior design. Helmtex provides full custom color services at scale.
