          <p>
            Upholstery fabrics are textiles designed to cover and protect furniture such as sofas, chairs, ottomans, and cushions. These fabrics
            must withstand everyday wear and tear, resist stains, and remain aesthetically pleasing. Upholstery fabrics can be made from various
            materials, including natural, synthetic, and blends, each offering distinct benefits and properties suited for different applications.
          </p>
          <p>
